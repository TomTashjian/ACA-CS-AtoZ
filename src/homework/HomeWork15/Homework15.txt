Custom Range Generator:
Create a custom range generator using yield return.
The generator should take a start value and an end value and produce all integers in that range.
Example usage: foreach (var number in RangeGenerator(5, 10)) { Console.Write(number + " "); } should output 5 6 7 8 9 10

Create a custom linked list using yield return.
Implement methods like Add, Remove, and Contains.
Example: var myList = new CustomLinkedList<int>(); myList.Add(10); myList.Add(20); myList.Add(30);.

Generate the Fibonacci sequence using yield return.
Create an iterator that produces Fibonacci numbers up to a specified limit.
Example: foreach (var fib in FibonacciSequence(100)) { Console.Write(fib + " "); }.
