Use nested if statements to find and print the smallest value among the four numbers.

Task 17: Determine the Type of Triangle
Create three variables a, b, and c representing the sides of a triangle.
Use nested if statements to determine if the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
Print the type of triangle.

Task 18: Menu Selection Using Switch
Create a variable option and assign it a value between 1 and 5.
